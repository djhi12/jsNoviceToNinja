1. We'll start by creating an array called quiz that contains all the questions 
and answers. Each element in quiz will be a nested array that contains the 
question as its first element and the answer as its second element.

1. Next, we’ll create and initialize a variable called score to keep track of 
how many correct answers the player has given:

/*
1. Then we'll loop through the array using a for-of loop, assigning the variables 
question and answer to each key and value in the map.
2. The loop starts by asking the question using a prompt dialog that allows the 
player to enter an answer that is stored in a variable called response . We can 
then compare this to the actual answer stored as answer :
3. An if ... else block is then used to check if the answer is right or wrong. 
If it’s right, an alert dialog is shown saying it is correct and the score is 
incremented by 1, using score++ . Otherwise, if the answer is wrong, an alert 
dialog informs the player and also lets them know the correct answer.

/*
1. When the loop has finished iterating through each question in the array, it 
breaks out of the block and finishes by displaying another alert dialog to inform 
the player the game is over and telling them how many questions they answered 
correctly. This uses a template literal to display the score:
2. Notice at the end of this template literal, we use the ternary operator to check 
if the score is not equal to 1. If this is true, the letter 's' is appended to the 
end of the word 'point' to make it plural. This is a neat trick that can sometimes 
be overlooked, even on professional websites.
*/
// At the end of the game, report the player's score
alert(`Game Over, you scored ${score} point${score !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
